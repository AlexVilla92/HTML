		<h1>"The force is strong in my family"</h1>
		
		<p>  <!--Con la etiqueta <strong>tambien lo pone en negrita, pero ademas lo hace mas sensible a la busqueda</strong> -->
			This quote was taken from <b>Return Of The Jedi (1983)</b>. 
			In it, Luke meets Leia on the planet of Endor before departing 
			on his mission to confront Darth Vader for the final time.<br/> Through these 
			quotes he reveals to her that she is his sister. It was used in the second 
			trailer for The Force Awakens but does not seem to appear in the final film.

		<h2>"Why luke said that?"</h2>
		
		<p>
			<cite>Luke Skywalker</cite>
			
		    <blockquote>
				"The Force is strong in my family. My father has it. I have it. And...my sister has it."
			</blockquote>

			<h3>The explication</h3>
			
			Also, there's a minor correction. The first line is, <b>"The Force is strong in my family.
			My father has it"</b>. While at the time it seemed appropriate given that Vader was alive, 
			its use in the trailer sparked some debate as to whether Vader had somehow survived the events 
			of <i>Return Of The Jedi</i> (as a Force Ghost perhaps).
